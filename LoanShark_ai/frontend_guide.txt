## 1. Big Picture – What LoanShark AI Does (In UX Terms)

**One sentence for the frontend dev:**

> “LoanShark AI lets a user upload or paste a loan contract, then shows a risk score and clearly highlights dangerous clauses in plain language.”

From the frontend side, this boils down to:

1. Let user **give us a document** (upload OR paste).
2. Show that **we’re analyzing** it (loading state).
3. Display **results**:

   * Risk score (0–100)
   * Risk label (Safe / Caution / High Risk / Predatory)
   * List of reasons
   * Highlighted text snippets
   * Confidence and disclaimers
4. Handle **errors** nicely (bad file, server down, etc.).

Everything else (backend, ML, logic) is a black box behind an API.

## 2. Site Structure – Pages & Flows

Your frontend should have *roughly* this structure:

1. **Landing Page / Home**

   * Hero section explaining what the tool does.
   * Call to action: **“Scan a loan”**.
   * Short “How it works” section.
   * Quick legal disclaimer.

2. **Analyzer Page**

   * Main interactive screen.
   * Input methods:

     * Text paste
     * File upload (PDF / image)
   * “Analyze” button.
   * Loading state while waiting for backend.
   * Results section: score, label, reasons, highlights.

3. **About / Learn More (optional)**

   * More detailed explanation for judges and users:

     * Why predatory loans are bad.
     * What kinds of clauses we scan for.
     * Brief “How our AI works” description (no deep tech).

4. **Global layout**

   * Simple header with logo + name (“LoanShark AI”).
   * Simple footer with:

     * Disclaimer
     * Contact / GitHub / Devpost links.

The **Analyzer Page** is the star of the show. Landing page sells the story, Analyzer shows the magic.

## 3. Detailed UX for Each Screen

### 3.1 Landing Page (Home)

**Goals:**

* Make it instantly clear what LoanShark AI does.
* Make it insanely easy to start a scan.

**Sections:**

1. **Header**

   * Logo (simple shark/guard icon if you want).
   * Product name: **LoanShark AI**.
   * Navigation:

     * Home
     * Analyze
     * About (optional)

2. **Hero Section**

   * Big headline:

     > “Scan your loan before it bites.”
   * Subtext:

     > “Upload any loan agreement and get a Predatory Risk Score + clause warnings in under 60 seconds.”
   * Primary button:

     > “Start a Scan”

     * This should navigate to the Analyzer page.

   Optional: small badge like “Built for Snow Fest Hackathon”.

3. **How It Works**

   * 3 simple steps (visual, icons or cards):

     1. Upload or paste your loan contract.
     2. Our AI scans it for predatory clauses.
     3. You get a risk score + explanations.

4. **What We Flag (for credibility)**

   * A row of 4–6 small items:

     * High APR and hidden fees
     * Rollovers and balloon payments
     * Auto-debits and wage assignments
     * Arbitration and legal waivers
   * Each with a 1‑line explanation.

5. **Disclaimer Section**

   * Short, non-scary text:

     > “LoanShark AI provides educational analysis only. It is not legal or financial advice. Always consult a qualified professional before signing a contract.”

6. **Footer**

   * Link to Devpost / GitHub / email.
   * Tiny copyright.

### 3.2 Analyzer Page (Main Tool)

**Main UX principle:**
Make the scan flow **zero friction** and **super clear**.

#### Layout

Think of it as two main zones:

* **Top**: Input area (document upload/paste + Analyze button).
* **Bottom**: Results area (empty at first, then filled after API returns).

#### Input Area

Elements to include:

1. **Title**

   * “Analyze a Loan Agreement”

2. **Short hint text**

   * Example:

     > “Upload a PDF/image of your loan or paste the text below. We’ll scan it for predatory clauses.”

3. **Tabs or toggle for input mode** (optional but nice UX):

   * Tab 1: **Upload document**

     * File input that accepts PDF, PNG, JPG.
     * Helper text:

       > “Clear, single-page scans work best.”
   * Tab 2: **Paste text**

     * Large multiline textarea.
     * Placeholder:

       > “Paste the text of your loan agreement here…”

4. **Analyze button**

   * Prominent button:

     > “Analyze this loan”
   * Disabled if:

     * No file selected AND no text in textarea.
   * On click:

     * Show loading state.
     * Call backend API.

5. **Loading state**

   * While waiting for API:

     * Replace Analyze button with spinner OR show overlay:

       > “Analyzing your loan… This usually takes a few seconds.”
     * Disable inputs to avoid double submissions.

#### Results Area

This should be **hidden or empty** until you have a result.

Once the backend responds, show:

1. **Overall Risk Summary Card**

   * Large section at top.
   * Show:

     * **Risk label**: Safe / Caution / High Risk / Predatory
     * **Risk score**: 0–100 (maybe as a meter/bar/circle)
     * **Confidence**: High / Medium / Low
   * Color suggestions (you choose exact style):

     * Safe → green
     * Caution → yellow/orange
     * High Risk → red
     * Predatory → dark red
   * Short sentence under it:

     * Example for High Risk:

       > “This loan shows multiple signs of predatory behavior. Review the flagged clauses carefully before signing.”
     * Example for Safe:

       > “We didn’t detect major red flags. Still, consider consulting a professional for advice.”

2. **Reasons / Key Warnings List**

   * Section title: “Top reasons for this risk score”
   * Use a list or cards. Each item corresponds to a backend “reason” string.
   * For each reason, show:

     * Short title tag: e.g. “High APR”, “Arbitration clause”, “Auto-debit access”.
     * Explanation text from backend.
   * Make these **scan-friendly**: bold keywords, short paragraphs.

3. **Highlighted Snippets**

   * Section title: “Flagged clauses from your contract”
   * This comes from backend `highlights[]` (each with `text` + `category`).
   * Show them as small cards or a list:

     * Show the original snippet in quotes or code-like styling.
     * Small label for category, e.g. “Category: Legal Trap Clause”.
   * Optional: color-code by category (subtle).

   You **don’t** have to reconstruct the full contract with inline highlights unless you want to. For MVP, listing dangerous snippets is enough.

4. **Confidence & Disclaimer**

   * If confidence is not “High”, show a subtle warning:

     * > “Some parts of this document were hard to read (low-quality scan). Results may be incomplete.”
   * Below everything, repeat a disclaimer:

     * > “This analysis is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal or financial advice.”

5. **CTA for another scan**

   * Button:

     > “Scan another loan”
   * Scrolls back to input area and resets results.

#### Error States

Don’t forget to handle:

* **API error** (server down, timeout, invalid response):

  * Show a friendly message:

    > “Something went wrong during analysis. Please try again or use a clearer document.”
  * Show a “Try again” button.
* **Validation error** (no file or text):

  * Show inline error below input:

    > “Please upload a document or paste some text to analyze.”

### 3.3 About Page (Optional but nice for Devpost)

Sections:

1. **What is LoanShark AI?**

   * Simple story: we help people understand risky loan contracts.

2. **Types of red flags we detect**

   * List categories in user-friendly text.

3. **How the AI works (non-technical)**

   * One paragraph:

     > “Behind the scenes, LoanShark AI analyzes your contract for known predatory patterns (like rollover language, arbitration waivers, auto-debit rights, etc.) and combines these findings into a Predatory Risk Score. It also uses a lightweight machine learning model trained on sample contracts to refine the risk estimate. Everything runs fast and locally on the backend.”

4. **Limitations**

   * Mention:

     * It might miss some issues.
     * Not legal advice.

This page is often read by **judges** to see how thoughtful the product is.

## 4. How the Frontend Talks to the Backend (Simple API Contract)

You don’t need to know anything about ML. Just treat the backend as a service that accepts a document and returns JSON.

Assume the backend exposes:

### `POST /analyze`

* **If sending text**:

  * You’ll send JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "text": "full loan contract text here..."
    }
    ```

* **If sending a file**:

  * You’ll send a multipart request with:

    * `file` field for PDF/image.
    * (Optionally a text field if both.)

The backend will respond with JSON shaped roughly like:

```json
{
  "score": 85,
  "label": "Predatory",
  "confidence": "Medium",
  "reasons": [
    "APR is approximately 420%, which is extremely high.",
    "Loan allows multiple rollovers with added fees.",
    "Mandatory arbitration clause found (you waive your right to sue)."
  ],
  "highlights": [
    { "text": "Annual Percentage Rate: 420%", "category": "ExcessiveCost" },
    { "text": "may be renewed up to 6 times", "category": "DebtCycle" },
    { "text": "resolved exclusively by binding arbitration", "category": "LegalTrap" }
  ]
}
```

Your responsibilities:

* Show loading while waiting.
* If `label` comes back:

  * Use it to decide colors & wording.
* Iterate over `reasons` and `highlights` to render UI.

If backend changes field names slightly, you only adjust how you read JSON — no ML knowledge needed.

## 5. Visual Style & UX Suggestions (You Decide the Stack)

You can choose **any** frontend stack you like. Don’t worry about backend constraints.

Some design principles that fit this product:

* **Feel**:

  * Professional but approachable (fintech + safety).
  * Colors:

    * Neutral backgrounds.
    * Accent color for brand (maybe teal or deep blue).
    * Semantic colors for risk levels.

* **Typography**:

  * One clean sans-serif font.
  * Clear hierarchy:

    * Big titles for risk label.
    * Medium weight for reasons.
    * Small but readable body text for explanations.

* **Responsiveness**:

  * Should work well on:

    * Laptop screens (judge demo).
    * Medium mobile screens (nice bonus).
  * Input area and results stack vertically on mobile.

* **Accessibility**:

  * Good color contrast (especially for red and yellow risk states).
  * Use actual text, not just icons, to indicate meanings (e.g., “High Risk” text plus color).
  * Labels for inputs (file upload, text area).

If you want, next step I can:

* Help you draft **exact microcopy** for all UI texts (headlines, tooltips, warnings),
  *or*
* Turn this into a more “design system” spec (component list: Button, Card, Tag, RiskBadge, etc.) so your frontend dev can build reusable pieces.
